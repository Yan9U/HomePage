Learning Journal: Mistakes and fixes

### Mistake 1: Invalid Tags like '<p1>'
    **why**: I thought I could create numbered paragraph tags
    **fix**:HTML doesn't allow custom tag names. Replaced all with '<p>'

### Mistake 2: CSS Linked Outside HTML
    **why**:I added '<link>' after '</html>'
    **fix**:Moved '<link>' into the '<head>' section.

Important:
    Use '<section>' to arrange content
    The '<head>' is where all meta and CSS links should go
